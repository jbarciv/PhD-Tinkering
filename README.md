# PhD-Tinkering
Some (useful?) resources developed during my PhD to have fun and improve my workflow. I hope this can be useful to someone!

## My Mail Checker

This script checks your email daily for new arXiv papers, filters them by looking for a specific word (like "vehicle" in my case), and then forwards the relevant ones to another email. Itâ€™s automated with `cron` to save time by only sending papers that match your keyword.

For more information about the mail checker, see the [my_mail_checker/README.md](my_mail_checker/README.md) file.
